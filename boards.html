        <h3>ROBOTICS AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h3></br><br>
        Robots and connected embedded digital systems provide smart solutions that extend human capabilities. Powered by
        artificial intelligence and data generated in real-time by nature, people and the systems that exist within robots and drones,
        the degrees of autonomy surrounding us increase as they perform valued tasks. UATâ€™s Robotics and Embedded Systems
        (RES) degree provides students with the foundation for the design, implementation and analysis of embedded systems that
        make robots, drones and other platforms viable tools. A degree in RES incorporates mechanical design, digital logic design,
        embedded programming, machine vision, sensing, big data and artificial intelligence into the development and design of
        robotic systems that solve useful problems. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Robotics and
        Embedded Systems is 15.0405.
